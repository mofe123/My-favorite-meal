    <p>Boiled yam and egg sauce is a common breakfast choice in Nigerian homes. 
        Yam is a popular staple in West African countries which means lots of yam are planted annually to meet this demand. 
        According to the International Institute of Tropical Agriculture, Nigeria accounted for about 70 percent of the world's pro
        duction amounting to 17 million tonnes from land area 2,837,000 hectares under yam cultivation. Yams have a distinct brown skin 
        and can be white, yellow, purple, or pink inside depending on the type of yam and maturity.<br>
        Yam and Egg sauce is one of the breakfast staples in Nigeria or should I say weekend breakfast.</p>

    <h2> How to cook yam</h2>
    <ol> 
        <li> Slice yam into about 1-inch size and peel the skin off.</li>
        <li> Rinse in clean water till water runs clear and no residue in water.</li>
        <li> Put yam in a pan, add enough water to cover it, add salt and place on medium heat and cook till soft. <br> 
            Test with a fork, if it goes through, then the yam should be soft enough.<br> Drain water from yam if you want.</li>
    </ol>
    <h2> How to make egg sauce</h2>
    <ol> 
        <li>Break eggs into a shallow bowl, whisk till egg white and egg yolk are well combined, 
            add salt and whisk to combine then set it aside </li>
        <li>Place a frying pan on a medium/low heat, add of vegetable oil, heat for about 2-3 minutes. </li>
        <li> Add chopped peppers and onions (this should sizzle) and cook for about 4-5 minutes or till oil floats on the sauce, add salt, seasoning, curry and thyme. <br>
             Stir to combine ingredient with sauce and also avoid sauce sticking to the pan.</li>
        <li> Add whisked eggs to sauce and leave for about a minute before stirring. (this will allow the egg to set a bit) Stir to scramble egg.
